I’ve been building and breaking computers since middle school, I even got in trouble for that 👮‍♂️ 🫢.

Most recently, I held a lead role at a technically demanding, low-level crypto protocol. Before that, I was deeply involved in infrastructure and protocol engineering across multiple high-impact projects.

Currently, I split my time 50/50 between smart contract SR and active DeFi/MEV exploration. My work spans from theoretical modeling to real-time, adversarial environments.
